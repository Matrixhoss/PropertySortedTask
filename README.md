# Property Sorted Front-End App 

This is an implementation for the PropertySorted task

## Features

The front-end app should include the following features:

- **Navigation**: Users can navigate to the web app using the local server (localhost).

- **Property Listings**: A simple UI should display a collection of property compounds. Each compound listing should include its location and market sale price. You can refer to Airbnb.com for inspiration on how property listings are displayed.

- **Favorite Compounds**: Users can save specific compounds to their favorites list. Each compound listing could have a heart icon that users can click to add the compound to their favorites. The selected compounds should be stored in local storage.

- **Remove from Favorites**: Users should be able to remove compounds from their favorites list. This action should also clear the entire favorites list.

- **Compound Search**: Users should be able to search for compounds in the list.

- **Images for Compounds**: Incorporate images for compounds. These images can be random and do not need to be accurate.

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the app is responsive and works well on mobile devices.

- **Simplicity and Design**: Aim for a clean and simple design, taking inspiration from platforms like Google Flights or Airbnb.

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: Utilize the Material-UI library for building UI components.
